# Front End Test.

### Access.

To open the project: extract from the zip document, then launch index.html, this should open the webpage. I have printed the function results to the console (f12 while in google chrome) I haven't added cross-browser support for my page, so I recommend accessing the page in google chrome.

### Summary.

This task involved making a front end for a messaging application. There were some questions which involve working with a .JSON file which was given to us to use.
I opted for a minimal design with muted colours. I used a small square of vibrant colour on the left side of the message, which changes depending on the prefix. I felt comfortable dynamically Inputting the data using 'innerHTML' I also added a .JSON file to hold the messages which this function reads from.
At the start, I struggled with the JSON potion of the test. After doing some research into the flatting arrays and recursion, I was able to fix the first problems, and this helped when approaching the other 2 questions in this section. I've commented on the second question that I should have to use recursion there too.
I want to do more with my design, for example, add a header which contains information and links regarding the account login. Id also like to do some overlays when certain links are press, quick response when you click a persons email address for example. Lastly, I would have liked to make the message block expand when clicked.
