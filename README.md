# Front End Test.

### Access.

To open the project: extract from the zip document, then launch index.html, this should open the webpage. I have printed the function results to the console (f12 while in google chrome) I haven't added cross-browser support for my page, so I recommend accessing the page in google chrome

### Summary.

With my test, I opted for a minimal design with muted colours. I felt comfortable dynamically Inputting the data using innerHTML. I struggled with the JSON potion of the test. After doing some research into the flatting arrays, I was able to fix the problems presented, and this helped when approaching the other 2 questions in this section.# Front-end-test
